<h3>What is this?</h3>
Since Gemini is now readily available to developers, I have decided to create an easy to modify template to use the Gemini API for text output

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
If you want to use the Gemini API with my text template, simply edit the main.js file and add your own API key which you can get on <a href="https://aistudio.google.com">Google's AI Studio website</a>. I recommend expanding on it since this template merely serves as a starting point for your project.

<h3>Current limitations</h3>
<ol>
<li>This implementation does not send context to the API, meaning each question is as if you were asking the API a completely new question. It does not remember any previous questions.
<li> The API is currently not accessible from within the European Union. For you or your EU users to access it, they would need a VPN.
</ol>

<b>Huge props to Google for the Gemini API and the starter template which this project is based on</b>
